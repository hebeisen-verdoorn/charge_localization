# charge_localization
Charge localization algorithm for muon track reconstruction calibration.
If a muon passes very close by (~1m) a DOM, we would expect that it would deposit a large amount of charge in that DOM. Furthermore, if a muon passes very close to two DOMs on its trajectory through the detector, we would expect a large percentage of the total event charge to be localized to the two DOMs which it passed close by. If we draw a line between these two DOMs, we would expect that this line would be a good reconstruction of the true muon trajectory.
